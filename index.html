            My journey in programming started with scriptwriting in SQL, where I spent two years working as a Data Analyst. Aspiring to be a Software Developer, I am currently enhancing my knowledge by completing my studies in Diploma of Software Development, volunteering to mentor women to code with Muses Code JS and also co-teaching Data Analytics with General Assembly. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, you would find me working on my web application WeDive. This application is intended to help divers connect and buddy up to dive together, there are additional features of scheduling dives and allow divers to log each dive.  The idea of WeDive is what inspired me to learn programming. I also enjoy volunteering at conferences, helping out at and attending events which helps me stay up-to-date with the latest practices and to network with peers, speakers, developers and sponsored companies.

                  As part of a team of three Danil, Mat and I had completed an ASP.Net Core Web Application, T2 Reservation Management System (T2RMS). This application was designed to take reservation made by Management, Staff and Members, we had extended the application where Managers and Staff can place reservations on tables via the creation method of selecting tables or a scheduler with a drag and drop feature. Working in an agile environment, Azure DevOps allowed our team to track our progress using the SCRUM process, checking in daily with updates of progress on weekly tasks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  This application shows the complex use of RESTful API’s, JavaScript, C#, SQL and Asynchronous programming. We have also used various plugins to meet satisfaction of our team’s agreements in its features and functionalities. I have added the assessment criteria "Application_Development_AE_Project", if you like to see the answers to the assessment please contact me via email.
                  </p>
                <p>
                  My teammates and I have the intention to keep working on the projects by refactoring and further enhancing the current features and also adding more when possible.

                This was my final project for Certificate IV in Programming, the assessment consisted of three parts; Database design and implementation, C# Coding and Unit Testing. The main outcome of the assessment was to develop a data-driven application by applying separation of concerns design principle. You can find the assessment outline attached to the GitHub repo, I had also added a few additional features, example: Regx to validate phone numbers and email address and auto increment ID number shown on UI design when adding a new employee to the system.

              WeDive is what set me on the path to become a developer! I wanted to hone the skills to create a functional application where divers can come online and look for other fellow divers as a buddy system. With the ability to log dives, calculate no-decompression limits, a chat platform for networking and also share wonderful experiences. I intend to finish this application over the next six to twelve months whilst studying Diploma of Software Development. I can see further growth with other languages other than HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript for this application.

              Acting in a support role for both the instructor and students, I would ensure that the students would understand the course material presented by the instructor. Mentoring students to ensure that they felt comfortable with the course work, providing one on ones with students that require extra time to understand the course outline. Assisting them through their homework, ensuring that they get the best understanding of the work set out. Giving feedback to the instructor, ways he/she can teach that would engage the class differently, to focus more on subjects that are required for the class pace.
